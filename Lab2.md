# Lab 2 - The Website
## Why
Your team is actually a promising startup developing an application like no other! Like any self respecting startup, you need a website to showcase your product.

This website will be included in the project work you are doing and you’ll keep refining it during the semester.

## In class
Agree on a starting format in class and implement it, HTML only.

## Homework
Add CSS styling (feel free to useBootStrap ([https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/)) or website templates from the web. Sky is the limit!

## About creating websites
If you want to master the basics of web programming, [http://w3schools.com](http://w3schools.com) is the best resource. I recommend getting through the tutorials for HTML,CSS and Javascript and then moving on to other topics such as bootstrap.

**Don’t be afraid of Google!** Feel free to search on the internet for things you don’t know. If you don’t understand feel free to reach out to your teaching assistant or friends. A successful programmer knows how to google things (it’s an art!) and that the key is understanding the solution. Mindless copy-pasting does more harm than good.
