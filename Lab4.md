# Lab 4 - Start with React
## Why
Now, that you learned the basics of React, let us see some examples in action.

## In class
Install the React library and create your first website using React following the course guidelines:

1. Install Visual Studio Code here: [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

2. Install Node.js and NPM here: [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en)

- When Node.js is installed, npm (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with it

3. VS Code, click on View, Terminal to open the built-in terminal

4. Run the command to add a brand new React app to the machine:

<code>npm init react-app firstapp</code>

5. Run:

<code>cd firstapp \
npm start</code>

6. Run the examples in the React course.

## Homework
Enhance the functionality of the existing examples using your imagination.
